Java Programming IT Park Course Material

Welcome to my Java Programming Course Material repository! Here you will find the content I studied during the course, including exercises and lessons, to share and review my knowledge in Java.

Course Content
The course is divided into several sections, covering the key concepts and topics of Java programming. Each section contains theoretical and practical lessons, as well as exercises in English to practice and reinforce the acquired knowledge.

Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

Lectures: This folder contains some of the practical examples we had in a few lessons. Several lessons are missing as my computer had issues, and I ended up losing a lot of material.

Pratice: Here we will find the solutions to the practice exercises assigned during the course. Again, there are missing solutions as I lost a portion of the files.

Resources: In this folder, we will find the provided material.
